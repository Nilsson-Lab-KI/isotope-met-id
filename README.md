This repository contains R code for reproducing results in the paper [Isotope tracing-based metabolite identification for mass spectrometry metabolomics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.07.647691v1) by Secilmis et al. To reproduce the results, clone this package, execute the scripts numbered `01`, `02,`, ..., `05` in order to prepare data structures and intermediate results, and then use the `Figure-X` script to reproduce individual figures. The expected results are shown in the original manuscript.

We use [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) to manage dependencies. If you use RStudio, renv should automatically install upon cloning this repo. You can then invoke `renv::update()` to install the necessary packages. In particular, the code in this repository relies on the [midist](https://github.com/Nilsson-Lab-KI/midist) package for implementing MID-based distance measures.
