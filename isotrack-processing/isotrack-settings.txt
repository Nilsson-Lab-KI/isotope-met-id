Isotracks works with the Thermo reader DLL. This must be installed on your computer to perform analyses.


** Isotrack settings **

We used the following permissive settings to avoid false negatives. Artefacts are removed in later steps. No de-isotoping was done, since mass isotopomer peaks are later detected by NetID. Peaks were required to be present in all replicates.

Mass Accuracy: 10
Intensity Threshold: 100000
Gap Scan Max: 2
Min RT Peak Width: 0.05
Max RT Peak Width: 10

Min Intensity: 100000
S/N Ratio: 1.5

No. C13 to Check: 0

Common in files: 3
RTError: 0.25
